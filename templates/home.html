        <p class="card-text"> A Strategic Response to the Organic Traffic Crisis in the Post-Click Era.
          Assessing the Political, Economic, Social, and Technological environment in light of the
          new paradigm of generative AI and its impact on corporate digital sovereignty.
          This study examines the influence of the PEST framework on the deployment of local
          fine-tuning solutions through AI-powered smart boxes—an urgent strategic response to the rise
          of generative AI. This new paradigm, dominated by response engines that centralize
          information, is already causing the collapse of traditional web traffic, with drops of up to 50% for
          certain publishers, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis cited by Forbes Colombia.</p>

        <p class="card-text">In 1991, a 22-year-old Finnish student named Linus Torvalds released a
          personal project: an open-source kernel called Linux. What started as an experiment
          became the biggest tech revolution since the invention of the internet—proving that
          world-changing innovation doesn’t require corporate backing, just vision and
          persistence.
          A product of the 80s hacker culture, Torvalds built a system where anyone could
          modify and improve the code—defying the monopoly of giants like Microsoft. His
          philosophy was simple: "Software is like sex; it's better when it's free." Yet beneath the
          humor was a radical idea: technology should belong to everyone, not just corporations.</p>
